<p>	Welcome to Open Image Server. This application is designed to hold your images
online and let you use hot links to those images.</p>
<p>	Open Image Server uses Google appengine authentication to login. 
Users should be administrator in order to use this application. Since this is a showcase,
 we allow everyone to log in and use the application. Just login and try it out!</p>
 <p>Please beware that this is a showcase version and we will cleanup all uploads and albums once in a while.
 If you need to store your images. check application and deploy your own version to appengine to use. It is open source
 and free to use.</p>
<p> OIS is really easy to use. First you should create an album and upload your images in it. We will give you hot links to those images that you can use anywhere.
Every image has multiple versions(which we call revisions) stored in OIS. In fact, first time you upload your image, we create two versions of your image. first is original and second is
thumbnail. You can create as many revisions as you want. Since appengine has a 1MB entry limit. OIS cannot store images bigger than 1MB(for now).
</p>

<p>In order to use your image in your site just click to a revision in image revisions window and
copy given url in that page. Every revision gets its own url and never changes. so you can be sure that url that you have
will always be the same image even if you rename your image from the app. it also helps browsers to cache the image. images will be downloaded one and cached.
Later calls for this image will be done useing browser caches.</p>
