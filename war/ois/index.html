<p>	Welcome to Open Image Server. This application is designed to hold your images
online and let you use direct links to those images in your own website.</p>
<p>	OIS(Open Image Server) uses google appengine authentication to login. 
Users should be application administrators in order to use this application. Since this is a showcase,
 we allow everyone to log in and use the application. Just login and try it out!</p>
 <p>Please beware that this is a showcase version and we will cleanup all uploads and albums once in a while.
 If you need to store your images, checkout <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openimageserver/">application homepage</a> and deploy your own version to appengine.
  OIS is an open source project and free to use. You can also integrate it to your own projects.</p>
<p> OIS is really easy to use. First you should create an album and upload your images in it. You will be given direct links to those images that you can use anywhere.
Every image has multiple versions(which we call revisions) stored in OIS. In fact, first time you upload your image, we create two versions of your image. The first one is original and the second one is
thumbnail. You can create as many revisions as you want.
</p>

<p>In order to use your image in your site just click on a revision in <i>"Image Revisions"</i> page and
copy the given url in that page. Every revision gets its own url and never changes. So you can be sure that url that you have
will always be the same image. It also helps browsers to cache the image. 
Later calls for this image will use browser cache.</p>
